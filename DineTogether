# DineTogether
## Inspiration
I used to feel lonely while eating in the dining court but was too afraid and shy to ask others if I could sit with them because I was worried about interfering with their privacy. 
## What it does
A chat messaging which lets students create account and tell others they are available and others may join them.
## How we built it
The project was based on Client-server architecture which features a heavy server and light client with processing and storing files on server side. A new thread was spawned for each client so that they were independent of each other.
## Challenges we ran into
It was challenging to send all the messages received from the client to other clients so that they can display it on their GUIs.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The project fulfilled its main purpose that users can create accounts and then send messages flawlessly.
## What we learned
It is important to think about the ideas as clearly as possible before starting working and be patient while debugging.
## What's next for DineTogether
We want to enhance the java application further and convert it into a webpage and launch it on Purdue campus and then on other college campuses.
