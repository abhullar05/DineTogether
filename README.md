# DineTogether
College students especially freshmen want to interact and connect with more people. DineTogether can enable them to dine with other interested students with help of a chat platform.

Inspiration : I used to feel lonely while eating in the dining court but was too afraid and shy to ask others if I could sit with them because I was worried about interfering with their privacy.

What it does : A chat messaging which lets students create account and tell others they are available and others may join them.

How was it built : The project was based on Client-server architecture which features a heavy server and light client with processing and storing files on server side. A new thread was spawned for each client so that they were independent of each other.

Challenges faced : It was challenging to send all the messages received from the client to other clients so that they can display it on their GUIs.
